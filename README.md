# tn-broadband-app
This repository contains documentation and source files for the deployed app at https://tn-broadband.herokuapp.com. The app helps broadband companies identify specific areas in Tennessee to capture new customers, including some opportunities to simultaneously grow revenue while also starting to close racial and ethnic gaps in household broadband.

For information on the modeling procedure, see TN_Broadband_Modeling.ipynb, and for the python script that runs the app, see tn-broadband.py

## TN_Broadband_Modeling.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook detailing the data import, processing, modeling, and export procedures to create files used by the web app.

## tn-broadband.py
Python script running the web app. Uses streamlit, bokeh, and geopandas to create interactive plots from saved modeling outputs.

## Modeling outputs:
map_df_tn.pkl, Predicted_vs_Actual.png, and Black_Income_Broadband.png, all generated by TN_Broadband_Modeling.ipynb

## Files supporting streamlit and heroku framework:
requirements.txt, setup.sh, procfile

## Other supporting files:
TN_County_Codes: the US Census code designating each TN county, used by the app to filter by county.
